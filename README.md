# Angular Coding Challenges

**Live Demo:**  
https://seanconroy-dev.github.io/angular-coding-challenges/

An Angular application implementing common coding challenges with interactive user interfaces for entering inputs and testing outputs.  
The challenges are based on Java programming exercises and have been reimplemented in TypeScript using Angular.

## Overview

This application does not provide problem statements for users to solve.  
Instead, it presents completed implementations of coding challenges that can be interactively tested through a graphical user interface.

The focus of the project is on:
- implementing algorithms and basic programming logic in TypeScript
- separating business logic from the user interface
- building reusable and structured Angular components
- allowing users to validate implementations through custom inputs

Each challenge is represented by its own UI, where inputs can be entered and results are displayed immediately.

## Implemented Coding Challenges

- Grade evaluation based on score input
- Weekday determination from numeric input
- Factorial calculation (n!)
- Counting vowels in a given text
- Minimum, maximum, and average value calculation
- Frequency analysis of numeric values
- Bubble sort algorithm
- Removing duplicate values from arrays

## Technologies Used

- Angular
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Angular Routing
- Standalone Components

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- Angular CLI

### Setup and Run

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

The application will be available at:  
http://localhost:4200
